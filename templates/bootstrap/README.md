# My Second Brain

This is your personal knowledge management system using the BASB methodology.

## PARA Structure

- **projects/** - Active initiatives with specific goals and deadlines
- **areas/** - Ongoing responsibilities that need sustained attention
- **resources/** - Topics of interest and reference material
- **archives/** - Completed projects and inactive items

## Getting Started

Start capturing notes! The structure will emerge naturally as you use it.

Ask Claude to help you:
- Capture new notes: "Save this idea to my second brain"
- Find information: "What notes do I have about [topic]?"
- Weekly review: "Let's review my projects and areas"
- Process research: "Summarize my research on [topic]"

## Tips

- Notes are markdown files - use headers, lists, and links freely
- Link between notes using relative paths: `[related note](./other-note.md)`
- Let Claude suggest organization - it understands BASB principles
- Review and refine regularly - knowledge management is iterative
