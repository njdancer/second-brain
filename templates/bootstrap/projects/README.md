# Projects

Short-term efforts with defined goals and deadlines.

A project should:
- Have a clear outcome you're working toward
- Have a deadline (even if approximate)
- End at some point (then move to archives)

Examples:
- Launch new website by Q4
- Learn Spanish for vacation in June
- Plan and execute office move
