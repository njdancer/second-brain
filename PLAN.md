# Implementation Plan

**Project:** MCP Server for Building a Second Brain (BASB)
**Status:** ‚ùå **BROKEN - MCP Initialize Endpoint Not Working**
**Version:** v1.2.13
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-11

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL ISSUE - MCP Server Not Working

**THE ONLY GOAL:** Get MCP server working in Claude desktop/web

**Current State:**
- ‚úÖ OAuth flow works (client registration, PKCE, token exchange)
- ‚ùå **MCP `/mcp` initialize endpoint BROKEN** - returns invalid JSON or times out
- ‚ùå OAuth test script incomplete (token saving is TODO)
- ‚ùå Cannot validate server works because test script is broken
- ‚ùå **Claude desktop/web cannot connect to server**

**What Was Broken:**
1. ~~POST `/mcp` with initialize request returns "Unexpected end of JSON input"~~ ‚úÖ FIXED - Implemented proper event emitter for request body streaming
2. ~~Test script `scripts/test-mcp-with-oauth.ts` has unimplemented TODO for token saving~~ ‚úÖ FIXED

**What Needs to Happen (IN ORDER):**
1. ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** - Fix test script to save tokens properly (implemented saveTokenToEnv function)
2. ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** - Debug and fix MCP initialize endpoint (fixed event emitter in Durable Object)
3. üî® **IN PROGRESS** - Run full OAuth test script end-to-end successfully (deploy + test)
4. ‚è≥ Test actual Claude desktop/web connection
5. Only then can we claim "Production Ready"

## Current Status

**Deployed:** v1.2.13 (deployed but broken)
**CI/CD:** ‚úÖ Operational (GitHub Actions, ~35s cycle time)
**Test Coverage:** ‚úÖ 278 tests passing, 85.05% function coverage
**Architecture:** Durable Objects for stateful sessions, direct Fetch API handlers
**Release Process:** ‚úÖ Automated release script working

**Recent Deployments:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **v1.2.13:** Fixed rate limit double-increment bug, improved test coverage (BUT MCP endpoint still broken)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **v1.2.12:** Enhanced structured logging (BUT MCP endpoint still broken)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **v1.2.9-11:** Durable Objects migration (BUT never validated MCP endpoint actually works)

**The Problem:**
We've been deploying code with unit tests passing, but never validated the actual MCP protocol works end-to-end with real clients. The OAuth test script exists to catch this, but it's incomplete.

## Phase 16 - Durable Objects Session Management ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**

**Goal:** Fix session persistence by migrating to Cloudflare Durable Objects

**Status:** ‚úÖ Deployed to production as v1.2.9

### Completed Tasks

‚úÖ **All tasks complete** - v1.2.9 deployed successfully
- Created MCPSessionDurableObject class with full session lifecycle management
- Configured wrangler.toml with Durable Objects bindings and migrations
- Updated mcp-api-handler.ts to route all requests to Durable Objects
- Cleaned up mcp-transport.ts (removed in-memory session storage)
- Added comprehensive test suite for Durable Object class
- Created cloudflare:workers mock for testing
- All tests passing (263/263) with 85.33% coverage
- Type checking passing
- Development environment deployed and tested
- Production deployment via GitHub Actions successful

### Implementation Details

**Files Created:**
- `src/mcp-session-do.ts` - Durable Object class with session management
- `test/unit/mcp-session-do.test.ts` - Comprehensive test suite
- `test/mocks/cloudflare-workers.ts` - Mock for testing

**Files Modified:**
- `wrangler.toml` - Added Durable Objects binding and migrations
- `src/index.ts` - Exported Durable Object, updated Env type
- `src/mcp-api-handler.ts` - Routes to Durable Object stubs
- `src/mcp-transport.ts` - Removed global session storage
- `jest.config.js` - Added module mapper for cloudflare:workers

### Results

‚úÖ Sessions persist across Worker instances
‚úÖ 30-minute session timeout with automatic cleanup
‚úÖ Free tier compatible (100k requests/day)
‚úÖ Test coverage increased from 79% to 85.33%
‚úÖ All CI/CD checks passing
‚úÖ Production deployment successful

## Future Phases (Parking Lot)

### Phase 17: Storage Quota Warnings (Nice to Have)
Add proactive warnings when approaching storage limits:
- Warning at 80% of quota
- Alert at 90% of quota
- Graceful degradation near limits

### Phase 18: Response Adapter Extraction (Low Priority)
Extract response adapter to separate module for better testability.

### Phase 19: Additional Monitoring (Future)
- Tool execution duration tracking
- Error rate monitoring
- Usage patterns analysis

## Development Workflow

1. Check PLAN.md for next task
2. Write tests first (TDD)
3. Implement feature
4. Run `pnpm test` (must pass)
5. Run `pnpm run type-check` (must pass)
6. Update PLAN.md status
7. Commit (include PLAN.md update)
8. Push to GitHub (triggers CI/CD)

**Deploy:** Always via GitHub Actions (never `pnpm deploy`)
