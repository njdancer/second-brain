# Implementation Plan

**Project:** MCP Server for Building a Second Brain (BASB)
**Status:** âœ… Production Ready - Phase 15A Complete
**Version:** v1.2.8 (ready to release)
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-11

---

## Current Status

**Code:** âœ… Fixed - Ready for v1.2.8 release
**Deployed:** ðŸ”´ v1.2.7 still deployed (BROKEN)
**CI/CD:** âœ… Operational (GitHub Actions, 37s test cycle)
**Test Coverage:** âœ… 258 tests passing, 79% coverage
**Architecture:** Direct Fetch API handlers, no frameworks
**Release Process:** âœ… Automated release script ready

**Recent Completions:**
- âœ… **Phase 15A:** Fixed MCP method handling
  - Removed incorrect POST-only restriction
  - Only parse JSON body for POST requests
  - GET/DELETE requests now properly handled
  - All tests passing, type check clean
- âœ… **v1.2.6:** Added /health endpoint for deployment verification
- ðŸ”´ **v1.2.7:** BROKEN in production - rejects GET requests (fix ready)

**Next:** Release v1.2.8 to fix production

---

## Phase 15 - Release v1.2.8 (URGENT)

**Goal:** Deploy v1.2.8 to fix broken production

### Tasks

1. **Release v1.2.8:**
   - Run: `EDITOR=true pnpm run release` (auto-generate changelog)
   - Push: `git push origin main --tags`
   - Monitor GitHub Actions deployment
   - Verify deployment successful

2. **Post-Deployment Verification:**
   - Check Cloudflare Logs for successful GET requests
   - Verify SSE streaming works
   - Test POST JSON-RPC requests
   - Verify DELETE session termination

**Commands:**
```bash
# Create release (auto-generate changelog)
EDITOR=true pnpm run release

# Deploy
git push origin main --tags

# Verify
pnpm wrangler tail --format pretty
```

## Future Phases (Parking Lot)

### Phase 16: Storage Quota Warnings (Nice to Have)
Add proactive warnings when approaching storage limits:
- Warning at 80% of quota
- Alert at 90% of quota
- Graceful degradation near limits

### Phase 17: Response Adapter Extraction (Low Priority)
Extract Hono response adapter to separate module for better testability.

### Phase 18: Additional Monitoring (Future)
- Tool execution duration tracking
- Error rate monitoring
- Usage patterns analysis

## Development Workflow

1. Check PLAN.md for next task
2. Write tests first (TDD)
3. Implement feature
4. Run `pnpm test` (must pass)
5. Run `pnpm run type-check` (must pass)
6. Update PLAN.md status
7. Commit (include PLAN.md update)
8. Push to GitHub (triggers CI/CD)

**Deploy:** Always via GitHub Actions (never `pnpm deploy`)
