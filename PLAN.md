# Implementation Plan

**Project:** MCP Server for Building a Second Brain (BASB)
**Status:** âœ… Production Ready - v1.2.8 Deployed
**Version:** v1.2.8
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-11

---

## Current Status

**Deployed:** âœ… v1.2.8 in production (MCP method handling fixed)
**CI/CD:** âœ… Operational (GitHub Actions, ~35s cycle time)
**Test Coverage:** âœ… 258 tests passing, 79% coverage
**Architecture:** Direct Fetch API handlers, no frameworks
**Release Process:** âœ… Automated release script working perfectly

**Recent Completions:**
- âœ… **v1.2.8:** Fixed critical MCP method handling bug
  - Removed incorrect POST-only restriction from v1.2.7
  - Only parse JSON body for POST requests
  - GET (SSE streaming) and DELETE (termination) now work correctly
  - Deployed successfully via GitHub Actions
- âœ… **v1.2.6:** Added /health endpoint for deployment verification
- ðŸ”´ **v1.2.7:** Was broken (rejected GET requests) - now fixed in v1.2.8

## Future Phases (Parking Lot)

### Phase 16: Storage Quota Warnings (Nice to Have)
Add proactive warnings when approaching storage limits:
- Warning at 80% of quota
- Alert at 90% of quota
- Graceful degradation near limits

### Phase 17: Response Adapter Extraction (Low Priority)
Extract Hono response adapter to separate module for better testability.

### Phase 18: Additional Monitoring (Future)
- Tool execution duration tracking
- Error rate monitoring
- Usage patterns analysis

## Development Workflow

1. Check PLAN.md for next task
2. Write tests first (TDD)
3. Implement feature
4. Run `pnpm test` (must pass)
5. Run `pnpm run type-check` (must pass)
6. Update PLAN.md status
7. Commit (include PLAN.md update)
8. Push to GitHub (triggers CI/CD)

**Deploy:** Always via GitHub Actions (never `pnpm deploy`)
