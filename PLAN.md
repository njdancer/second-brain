# Implementation Plan

**Project:** MCP Server for Building a Second Brain (BASB)
**Status:** ✅ Production Ready - Phase 14 Complete
**Version:** v1.2.4
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-11

---

## Current Status

**Deployed:** ✅ Production (v1.2.4)
**CI/CD:** ✅ Operational (GitHub Actions, 37s test cycle)
**Test Coverage:** ✅ 258 tests, 79% coverage
**Architecture:** Direct Fetch API handlers, no frameworks

**Recent Completions (Phase 14):**
- Removed Hono dependency (~300 lines removed)
- Implemented structured JSON logging (Logger class)
- Wired up MonitoringService for OAuth and rate limiting
- Fixed CI test output suppression issue

---

## Next Up: Phase 15 - Verification & Polish

**Goal:** Verify production deployment and complete Phase 14 loose ends

### Tasks

**Smoke Tests:**
- [ ] Run E2E OAuth flow test against production
- [ ] Verify Claude.ai MCP integration works
- [ ] Test all tools (read, write, edit, glob, grep)
- [ ] Verify rate limiting is enforced

**Monitoring Verification:**
- [ ] Check Cloudflare Logs for structured JSON output
- [ ] Verify Analytics Engine data points are being written
- [ ] Confirm OAuth events are logged
- [ ] Validate request correlation (requestId) works

**Polish:**
- [ ] Add storage quota warnings (MonitoringService)
- [ ] Review and update any stale documentation
- [ ] Clean up any remaining TODOs in code
- [ ] Consider extracting response adapter (low priority)

**Commands:**
```bash
# Test OAuth flow
pnpm run test:mcp:oauth

# Check logs
pnpm wrangler tail --format pretty

# E2E smoke tests (requires deployed server)
pnpm run test:e2e
```

---

## Future Phases (Parking Lot)

### Phase 16: Storage Quota Warnings (Nice to Have)
Add proactive warnings when approaching storage limits:
- Warning at 80% of quota
- Alert at 90% of quota
- Graceful degradation near limits

### Phase 17: Response Adapter Extraction (Low Priority)
Extract Hono response adapter to separate module for better testability.

### Phase 18: Additional Monitoring (Future)
- Tool execution duration tracking
- Error rate monitoring
- Usage patterns analysis

## Development Workflow

1. Check PLAN.md for next task
2. Write tests first (TDD)
3. Implement feature
4. Run `pnpm test` (must pass)
5. Run `pnpm run type-check` (must pass)
6. Update PLAN.md status
7. Commit (include PLAN.md update)
8. Push to GitHub (triggers CI/CD)

**Deploy:** Always via GitHub Actions (never `pnpm deploy`)
