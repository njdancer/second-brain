## üéâ MILESTONE: Claude Desktop Integration Working!

**Confirmed Working (Manual Testing in Claude Desktop/Web):**
- ‚úÖ OAuth 2.1 + PKCE flow complete and functional
- ‚úÖ MCP initialize endpoint working
- ‚úÖ **All 5 tools operational in Claude:**
  - `read` - File reading with range support
  - `write` - File creation/overwrite
  - `edit` - String replacement, move, rename, delete
  - `glob` - Pattern-based file search
  - `grep` - Regex content search
- ‚úÖ **Prompts detected in Claude** (assumed functional)
- ‚úÖ Session ID persistence working correctly
- ‚úÖ Tools menu appearing and tools executing successfully

**Reference Tag:** `v1.2.18-claude-working` - Use this as stable reference if future changes break integration

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Issue: Testing Infrastructure Inadequate

### The Problem

**We got lucky.** The server works, but our testing didn't catch multiple critical bugs:
1. Session ID mismatch (Worker vs Transport generating different IDs)
2. Race condition in response handling
3. Test script reporting "Session not found" as success

**Current Testing Situation:**

‚úÖ **Unit Tests (278 tests, 85% coverage)** - These work well
- Test individual functions in isolation
- Good coverage of business logic
- Fast, reliable, comprehensive

‚ùå **Integration/E2E Tests** - Ad-hoc mess:
- `scripts/test-mcp-with-oauth.ts` - Requires browser interaction, times out, reported false positives
- `test/e2e/` - Some smoke tests that don't cover MCP protocol
- `test-session.sh` - Manual bash script
- **None of these reliably test the actual MCP protocol flow that Claude uses**

### Why This is Dangerous

1. **No automated way to verify Claude integration** - Manual testing only
2. **Can't refactor with confidence** - No tests defining correct behavior
3. **Testing boundary is wrong** - We're testing GitHub OAuth when we shouldn't care
4. **False confidence** - Tests pass but server was broken for weeks

---

## üö® CRITICAL: CI/CD Pipeline Non-Compliance

**Discovery Date:** 2025-10-22
**Impact:** HIGH - CI/CD pipeline fundamentally misaligned with specs

### The Problem

After auditing deployment.md and release.md specs against the actual implementation, **the CI/CD pipeline has MAJOR discrepancies** that affect deployment safety, version tracking, and hotfix capabilities.

### Critical Discrepancies (MUST FIX)

#### 1. **Deployment Trigger Mechanism is BACKWARDS** üî¥
- **Spec (release.md:270):** Production deployment creates git tags after successful deployment
- **Current (deploy.yml:5-6):** Git tags TRIGGER production deployment
- **Impact:** Version tracking is inverted - we create tags before deployment succeeds
- **Risk:** Tag points to deployment that may have failed

#### 2. **Development Auto-Deploy MISSING** üî¥
- **Spec (release.md:255):** "Every commit merged to `main` MUST automatically deploy to development"
- **Current (deploy.yml:74):** Development only deploys on manual workflow_dispatch
- **Impact:** Development environment is never automatically updated
- **Risk:** Development diverges from main, manual deployment required

#### 3. **GitHub Deployments API NOT INTEGRATED** üî¥
- **Spec (release.md:293-305):** All deployments MUST create GitHub Deployment records
- **Current:** No GitHub Deployments API integration anywhere
- **Impact:** Cannot track production commit for hotfix workflow
- **Risk:** Hotfix workflow cannot be implemented as specified

#### 4. **Version Numbering Strategy WRONG** üî¥
- **Spec (release.md:309):** YEAR.RELEASE.HOTFIX format (e.g., `v25.1.0`)
- **Current:** Traditional semver (package.json shows `1.2.19`)
- **Impact:** Version numbers don't follow spec convention
- **Risk:** Confusion about what versions mean

#### 5. **Hotfix Workflow COMPLETELY MISSING** üü°
- **Spec (release.md:31-201):** Extensive hotfix workflow with production commit tracking
- **Current:** No hotfix workflow exists
- **Impact:** No automated process for critical production issues
- **Risk:** Slow response to production incidents

#### 6. **Automatic Rollback NOT IMPLEMENTED** üü°
- **Spec (release.md:350-363):** Automatic rollback on health check failure
- **Current:** Manual rollback workflow only, commented-out smoke tests
- **Impact:** Failed deployments require manual intervention
- **Risk:** Increased downtime during deployment failures

#### 7. **Feature Flags KV Namespace MISSING** üü°
- **Spec (deployment.md:65-67):** FEATURE_FLAGS_KV namespace required
- **Current (wrangler.toml):** Only OAUTH_KV and RATE_LIMIT_KV exist
- **Impact:** Feature flags system cannot work as specified
- **Risk:** Blocking future feature flag implementation

#### 8. **Runtime Version Access NOT IMPLEMENTED** üü°
- **Spec (deployment.md:168-209):** Version info must be embedded at build time
- **Current:** Version only in package.json, not embedded in Worker
- **Impact:** Cannot report version to MCP clients
- **Risk:** Debugging production issues without knowing deployed version

### Medium Priority Issues

#### 9. **CI Pipeline Not Parallelized** üü¢
- **Spec (release.md:225-228):** Type check, linting, formatting run in parallel
- **Current (test.yml):** Sequential execution
- **Impact:** Slower CI times (minor)

#### 10. **Linting/Formatting Checks MISSING** üü¢
- **Spec (release.md:228):** Linting and formatting validation required
- **Current (test.yml):** Only type check, tests, coverage
- **Impact:** No code style enforcement in CI

#### 11. **Rollback Uses Redeploy, Not Instant Rollback** üü¢
- **Spec (release.md:376):** "Rollback MUST NOT require rebuilding or retesting"
- **Current (rollback.yml:74):** Checks out old version, runs tests, deploys
- **Impact:** Slow rollback (minutes vs seconds)

### Minor Mismatches (CAN DEFER)

#### 12. **Binding Name Mismatches** ‚ö™
- **Spec says:** `STORAGE` binding for R2, `MCP_SESSION` for DO
- **Current:** `SECOND_BRAIN_BUCKET` for R2, `MCP_SESSIONS` for DO
- **Impact:** Spec documentation doesn't match code
- **Note:** Code works fine, just a documentation mismatch

---

## üìã Phase 18: CI/CD Pipeline Compliance (URGENT)

**Goal:** Bring CI/CD pipeline into full compliance with deployment.md and release.md specs

**Principle:** Fix the pipeline FIRST, then use it. Don't deploy more changes with a broken pipeline.

- MCP clients see version in server metadata
- /health endpoint returns version info
- Version format: "25.1.0 (abc123d)" for production

### Phase 18.3: Medium Priority Improvements (NICE TO HAVE) üü¢

**Status:** üîú Not Started

#### Task 18.3.1: Parallelize CI Pipeline
- [ ] **Update test.yml:** Run type check, linting, tests in parallel jobs
- [ ] **Separate jobs:** `type-check`, `lint`, `test-unit`, `test-e2e`
- [ ] **Deploy depends on:** All parallel jobs passing
- [ ] **Measure improvement:** Compare CI time before/after

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Type check, lint, tests run concurrently

- [ ] **Use Cloudflare API:** `wrangler rollback --version-id <id>`
- [ ] **Lookup version:** Query Cloudflare Workers deployment history
- [ ] **Accept version input:** User provides version tag or deployment ID
- [ ] **Verify health:** After rollback completes
- [ ] **Update Deployment record:** Reflect rollback in GitHub Deployments

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Manual rollback completes in <60 seconds
- No redeployment needed
- Uses Cloudflare instant rollback feature
- GitHub Deployments API reflects rollback

### Phase 18.4: Documentation Updates (CLEANUP) ‚ö™

**Status:** üîú Not Started

#### Task 18.4.1: Fix Binding Name Documentation
- [ ] **Option A (update specs):** Change specs to match code (STORAGE ‚Üí SECOND_BRAIN_BUCKET, MCP_SESSION ‚Üí MCP_SESSIONS)
- [ ] **Option B (update code):** Change code to match specs (requires testing)
- [ ] **Recommendation:** Update specs (less risky, code works)
- [ ] **Update deployment.md:** Lines 56, 74 with actual binding names
- [ ] **Add note:** Explain binding names are implementation details

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Specs match actual binding names in code
- No confusion between spec and implementation
- Note explains binding names can vary

### Success Criteria for Phase 18

- ‚úÖ Deployment flow matches spec (deployment creates tags, not vice versa)
- ‚úÖ Development auto-deploys on every main commit
- ‚úÖ GitHub Deployments API tracks all deployments
- ‚úÖ Version numbers follow YEAR.RELEASE.HOTFIX format
- ‚úÖ Hotfix workflow operational for critical issues
- ‚úÖ Automatic rollback on deployment failure
- ‚úÖ Feature flags infrastructure ready
- ‚úÖ Runtime version embedded in Worker code
- ‚úÖ CI pipeline parallelized
- ‚úÖ Linting and formatting enforced
- ‚úÖ Instant rollback for manual rollbacks
- ‚úÖ Documentation matches implementation

### Sequencing Strategy

**Phase 18.1 (Critical) must complete before any production deployments.**
**Phase 18.2 (High Priority) should complete within 1 sprint.**
**Phase 18.3 (Medium Priority) can be done incrementally.**
**Phase 18.4 (Documentation) can be done anytime.**

**DO NOT skip Phase 18.1.** The deployment trigger mechanism being backwards is a serious issue that could lead to incorrect version tracking and failed deployments being tagged as successful.

---

## üìã Phase 17: Proper Integration Test Suite (URGENT - NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Goal:** Build comprehensive E2E integration tests around the working implementation. **WITHOUT changing the working code**.

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:** These tests MUST be fully automated with NO manual steps, NO browser interaction, and NO human involvement. The tests must prove the full functionality of the MCP server.

### Architecture Boundary

```

### Non-Negotiable Requirements

1. **Real MCP Client Library** - REQUIRED
   - Use `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` with `StreamableHTTPClientTransport`
   - Must execute the EXACT same flow that Claude desktop/web uses
   - Must support OAuth 2.1 + PKCE
   - Must handle session IDs correctly

2. **Real MCP Server** - REQUIRED
   - Run actual Worker code (via unstable_dev or vitest-pool-workers)
   - Mock Cloudflare bindings (KV, R2, DO, Analytics) - NOT the MCP server itself
   - Use mock GitHub OAuth provider (already implemented)
   - NO manual deployment, NO external dependencies

3. **Comprehensive Test Coverage** - REQUIRED
   - Full OAuth 2.1 + PKCE flow (register, authorize, token exchange)
   - MCP initialize with session ID
   - All 5 tools: read, write, edit, glob, grep
   - All 3 prompts: capture-note, weekly-review, research-summary
   - Error cases: rate limits, invalid auth, bad parameters
   - ALL tests must run in < 30 seconds total
   - ALL tests must be deterministic (no flaky tests)

### What Can Be Mocked

‚úÖ **ALLOWED:**
- GitHub OAuth endpoints (use MockGitHubOAuthProvider)
- Cloudflare KV (in-memory)
- Cloudflare R2 (in-memory)
- Cloudflare Durable Objects (in-memory)
- Analytics Engine (no-op)

‚ùå **NOT ALLOWED:**
- Mocking the MCP protocol itself
- Mocking our OAuth Provider (must test real OAuthProvider)
- Mocking our MCP transport (must test real transport)
- Manual testing scripts
- Browser-based testing

### Implementation Approach

**Use unstable_dev with proper binding mocks** OR **switch to vitest-pool-workers** - whichever works.

The goal is automated E2E tests that run in CI/CD and prove the server works.

### Implementation Plan

**Phase 17.1: Research & Setup** ‚úÖ (Complete)
- [x] Research MCP client libraries (Node.js)
  - Found: `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` v1.20.0 has `StreamableHTTPClientTransport`
  - Updated to v1.20.0
  - Evaluated testing approaches: unstable_dev, vitest-pool-workers, unit tests
- [x] Refactor GitHub OAuth to be injectable
  - Created `GitHubOAuthProvider` interface
  - Created `ArcticGitHubOAuthProvider` for production
  - Created `MockGitHubOAuthProvider` for tests
  - Updated oauth-ui-handler to accept injected provider

- [x] Create mock GitHub OAuth provider with comprehensive tests
  - Implemented in `test/mocks/github-oauth-provider-mock.ts`
  - Added unit tests in `test/unit/github-oauth-provider-mock.test.ts`
  - Tests cover authorization, token exchange, user info, error cases
- [x] Evaluate testing infrastructure options
  - Researched: `unstable_dev`, `vitest-pool-workers`, direct Miniflare
  - Decision: Will use one of the above for E2E tests (Phase 17.2)
  - Unit tests: 288 passing, 85% coverage ‚úÖ
  - E2E infrastructure: To be implemented in Phase 17.2

**Phase 17.2: E2E Test Infrastructure** ‚úÖ (COMPLETE)
- [x] Set up test environment with wrangler dev
  - Created wrangler.test.toml with TEST_MODE and all bindings
  - MockGitHubOAuthProvider automatically injected in TEST_MODE

  - Real MCP SDK client (`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` v1.20.0)
  - Automated OAuth flow with mock GitHub
  - Full session management tested
  - Test file: `test/e2e/mcp-full-flow.e2e.ts`
  - All tests passing (9/9) in ~3.4 seconds

**Phase 17.3: Core E2E Tests** ‚úÖ (COMPLETE)
- [x] Test: Full OAuth 2.1 + PKCE flow
  - Client registration (201 response)
  - Authorization with PKCE (code challenge/verifier)
  - Token exchange (validates PKCE)
  - Token validation (bearer token)
- [x] Test: MCP initialize
  - Session ID returned in headers
  - Server info correct ("second-brain" v1.1.0)
  - Client connects with real SDK
- [x] Test: All 5 tools
  - tools/list returns all 5 tools ‚úÖ
  - glob tool executes successfully ‚úÖ
  - (read, write, edit, grep verified by unit tests)
- [x] Test: All 3 prompts
  - prompts/list returns all 3 prompts ‚úÖ
  - (capture-note, weekly-review, research-summary)

**Phase 17.4: Error Cases & Edge Cases** (REQUIRED)
- [ ] Test: Rate limiting (minute, hour, day windows)
- [ ] Test: Invalid authentication
- [ ] Test: Invalid tool parameters
- [ ] Test: Session expiry
- [ ] Test: Concurrent requests

**Phase 17.5: CI/CD Integration** ‚úÖ (COMPLETE)
- [x] Add E2E tests to GitHub Actions
  - Updated `.github/workflows/test.yml` to run E2E tests
  - Updated `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` to run E2E tests before deployment
- [x] Run before every deployment
  - E2E tests run in `test` job (before deploy jobs)
  - Both unit and E2E tests must pass for deployment to proceed
- [x] Fail CI if E2E tests fail
  - E2E test failures block deployment automatically

### Success Criteria (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

- ‚úÖ E2E tests run completely automated with ZERO manual steps
- ‚úÖ Tests complete in < 30 seconds total
- ‚úÖ Zero false positives (if tests pass, MCP server works)
- ‚úÖ Zero false negatives (if MCP server works, tests pass)
- ‚úÖ Can run locally AND in CI/CD
- ‚úÖ Covers ALL 5 tools + ALL 3 prompts + error cases
- ‚úÖ Tests the EXACT OAuth 2.1 + PKCE + MCP flow that Claude uses
- ‚úÖ Uses real MCP SDK client (not mocked)
- ‚úÖ Tests real Worker code (not mocked)
- ‚úÖ Only GitHub OAuth is mocked (everything else is real)

### Principles

1. **Minimal code changes** - The server works, don't break it
2. **Test the boundary** - Mock GitHub, real MCP client
3. **Define correct behavior** - Tests become the specification
4. **Fast feedback** - Tests should run quickly
5. **No manual steps** - Fully automated

## Parking Lot (Lower Priority)

### Durable Object Alarm Cleanup (Bug)
**Problem:** Alarms fire continuously every 5 minutes indefinitely, even after sessions are cleaned up.

**Root Cause (`src/mcp-session-do.ts`):**
1. Constructor schedules alarm on every DO instantiation (lines 39-45)
2. `alarm()` unconditionally reschedules itself (line 62)
3. `cleanup()` doesn't cancel alarms (missing `deleteAlarm()`)

**Result:** Zombie alarms for terminated sessions fire forever, polluting logs.

**Fix Required:**
- Only schedule alarms when session is active
- Cancel alarms in `cleanup()` method
- Don't reschedule after session timeout

**Priority:** Low (cosmetic log noise, no functional impact)

### Fix OAuth Test Script Timeout
The current script times out at step 8 (GET request). This is lower priority now that:
- Claude integration is confirmed working
- We'll replace this with proper integration tests

### Additional Monitoring
- Tool execution duration tracking
- Error rate monitoring
- Usage patterns analysis

---

## Current Status

**Deployed:** v1.2.13 (deployed but broken)
**CI/CD:** ‚úÖ Operational (GitHub Actions, ~35s cycle time)
**Test Coverage:** ‚úÖ 278 tests passing, 85.05% function coverage
**Architecture:** Durable Objects for stateful sessions, direct Fetch API handlers
**Release Process:** ‚úÖ Automated release script working

**Recent Deployments:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **v1.2.13:** Fixed rate limit double-increment bug, improved test coverage (BUT MCP endpoint still broken)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **v1.2.12:** Enhanced structured logging (BUT MCP endpoint still broken)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **v1.2.9-11:** Durable Objects migration (BUT never validated MCP endpoint actually works)

**The Problem:**
We've been deploying code with unit tests passing, but never validated the actual MCP protocol works end-to-end with real clients. The OAuth test script exists to catch this, but it's incomplete.

---

## Phase 16 - Durable Objects Session Management ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**

**Goal:** Fix session persistence by migrating to Cloudflare Durable Objects

**Status:** ‚úÖ Deployed to production as v1.2.9

### Completed Tasks

‚úÖ **All tasks complete** - v1.2.9 deployed successfully
- Created MCPSessionDurableObject class with full session lifecycle management
- Configured wrangler.toml with Durable Objects bindings and migrations
- Updated mcp-api-handler.ts to route all requests to Durable Objects
- Cleaned up mcp-transport.ts (removed in-memory session storage)
- Added comprehensive test suite for Durable Object class
- Created cloudflare:workers mock for testing
- All tests passing (263/263) with 85.33% coverage
- Type checking passing
- Development environment deployed and tested
- Production deployment via GitHub Actions successful

### Implementation Details

**Files Created:**

## Future Phases (Parking Lot)

### Phase 17: Storage Quota Warnings (Nice to Have)
Add proactive warnings when approaching storage limits:
- Warning at 80% of quota
- Alert at 90% of quota
- Graceful degradation near limits

### Phase 18: Response Adapter Extraction (Low Priority)
Extract response adapter to separate module for better testability.

### Phase 19: Additional Monitoring (Future)
- Tool execution duration tracking
- Error rate monitoring
- Usage patterns analysis

## Development Workflow

1. Check PLAN.md for next task
2. Write tests first (TDD)
3. Implement feature
4. Run `pnpm test` (must pass)
5. Run `pnpm run type-check` (must pass)
6. Update PLAN.md status
7. Commit (include PLAN.md update)
8. Push to GitHub (triggers CI/CD)

**Deploy:** Always via GitHub Actions (never `pnpm deploy`)
