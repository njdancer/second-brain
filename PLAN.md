# Implementation Plan

**Project:** MCP Server for Building a Second Brain (BASB)
**Status:** ✅ Production Ready - v1.2.9 Deployed
**Version:** v1.2.9
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-11

---

## Current Status

**Deployed:** ✅ v1.2.9 in production (Durable Objects session management)
**CI/CD:** ✅ Operational (GitHub Actions, ~35s cycle time)
**Test Coverage:** ✅ 263 tests passing, 85.33% coverage
**Architecture:** Durable Objects for stateful sessions, direct Fetch API handlers
**Release Process:** ✅ Automated release script working perfectly

**Recent Completions:**
- ✅ **v1.2.9:** Migrated to Durable Objects for session persistence
  - MCPSessionDurableObject class manages stateful sessions
  - Each session ID maps to dedicated Durable Object instance
  - 30-minute session timeout with automatic cleanup
  - Sessions persist across Worker instances (fixes stateless issue)
  - Free tier compatible (new_sqlite_classes)
  - Test coverage: 85.33% (exceeds 79% requirement)
- ✅ **v1.2.8:** Fixed critical MCP method handling bug
- ✅ **v1.2.6:** Added /health endpoint for deployment verification

## Phase 16 - Durable Objects Session Management ✅ **COMPLETE**

**Goal:** Fix session persistence by migrating to Cloudflare Durable Objects

**Status:** ✅ Deployed to production as v1.2.9

### Completed Tasks

✅ **All tasks complete** - v1.2.9 deployed successfully
- Created MCPSessionDurableObject class with full session lifecycle management
- Configured wrangler.toml with Durable Objects bindings and migrations
- Updated mcp-api-handler.ts to route all requests to Durable Objects
- Cleaned up mcp-transport.ts (removed in-memory session storage)
- Added comprehensive test suite for Durable Object class
- Created cloudflare:workers mock for testing
- All tests passing (263/263) with 85.33% coverage
- Type checking passing
- Development environment deployed and tested
- Production deployment via GitHub Actions successful

### Implementation Details

**Files Created:**
- `src/mcp-session-do.ts` - Durable Object class with session management
- `test/unit/mcp-session-do.test.ts` - Comprehensive test suite
- `test/mocks/cloudflare-workers.ts` - Mock for testing

**Files Modified:**
- `wrangler.toml` - Added Durable Objects binding and migrations
- `src/index.ts` - Exported Durable Object, updated Env type
- `src/mcp-api-handler.ts` - Routes to Durable Object stubs
- `src/mcp-transport.ts` - Removed global session storage
- `jest.config.js` - Added module mapper for cloudflare:workers

### Results

✅ Sessions persist across Worker instances
✅ 30-minute session timeout with automatic cleanup
✅ Free tier compatible (100k requests/day)
✅ Test coverage increased from 79% to 85.33%
✅ All CI/CD checks passing
✅ Production deployment successful

## Future Phases (Parking Lot)

### Phase 17: Storage Quota Warnings (Nice to Have)
Add proactive warnings when approaching storage limits:
- Warning at 80% of quota
- Alert at 90% of quota
- Graceful degradation near limits

### Phase 18: Response Adapter Extraction (Low Priority)
Extract response adapter to separate module for better testability.

### Phase 19: Additional Monitoring (Future)
- Tool execution duration tracking
- Error rate monitoring
- Usage patterns analysis

## Development Workflow

1. Check PLAN.md for next task
2. Write tests first (TDD)
3. Implement feature
4. Run `pnpm test` (must pass)
5. Run `pnpm run type-check` (must pass)
6. Update PLAN.md status
7. Commit (include PLAN.md update)
8. Push to GitHub (triggers CI/CD)

**Deploy:** Always via GitHub Actions (never `pnpm deploy`)
