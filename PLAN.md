# Implementation Plan

**Project:** MCP Server for Building a Second Brain (BASB)
**Status:** ✅ **WORKING - MCP Server Operational**
**Version:** v1.2.17
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-12

## ⚠️ MCP Server Initializes But Tools Not Appearing in Claude

**Current State:**
- ✅ OAuth flow works (client registration, PKCE, token exchange, token saving)
- ✅ **MCP `/mcp` initialize endpoint WORKING** - returns valid JSON-RPC response
- ✅ JSON response mode enabled
- ✅ Response timing issue fixed (race condition resolved)
- ✅ All 278 tests passing
- ❌ **Tools menu empty in Claude** - No tools appearing despite successful initialization

**What Was Fixed:**
1. ✅ OAuth test script token saving implemented (`saveTokenToEnv` function) - v1.2.14
2. ✅ JSON response mode enabled in transport (`enableJsonResponse: true`) - v1.2.15
3. ✅ **CRITICAL FIX:** Race condition where `handleRequest()` resolved before transport wrote response - v1.2.16
   - Transport writes response asynchronously after promise resolves
   - Added promise to wait for `response.end()` to be called
   - Now wait for both `handleRequest()` AND `end()` with `Promise.all()`
   - Documented in specs/architecture.md

**What's Not Working:**

The initialize request succeeds and returns a valid response:
```json
{
  "result": {
    "protocolVersion": "2024-11-05",
    "capabilities": { "tools": {}, "prompts": {} },
    "serverInfo": { "name": "second-brain", "version": "1.1.0" },
    "instructions": "..."
  },
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1
}
```

**BUT** tools menu in Claude is empty. Likely causes:
1. **Session ID not being sent back by Claude in subsequent requests**
   - Test shows: `tools/list` request fails with "Missing session ID. Initialize a session first."
   - We return `mcp-session-id` header in initialize response
   - Claude may not be reading/sending it back in subsequent requests

2. **Tools not properly registered in capabilities**
   - Initialize response shows `capabilities: { tools: {}, prompts: {} }` (empty objects)
   - Should show tool count or tool list in capabilities
   - May need to expose tools differently in capabilities object

3. **Protocol version mismatch**
   - Using protocol version `2024-11-05`
   - May need different version for tool discovery

**Next Steps:**
- Investigate why tools aren't appearing in capabilities object
- Test tools/list endpoint directly with session ID
- Check Claude's actual requests (logs) to see if session ID is being sent
- Verify tool registration in mcp-transport.ts

## Current Status

**Deployed:** v1.2.13 (deployed but broken)
**CI/CD:** ✅ Operational (GitHub Actions, ~35s cycle time)
**Test Coverage:** ✅ 278 tests passing, 85.05% function coverage
**Architecture:** Durable Objects for stateful sessions, direct Fetch API handlers
**Release Process:** ✅ Automated release script working

**Recent Deployments:**
- ⚠️ **v1.2.13:** Fixed rate limit double-increment bug, improved test coverage (BUT MCP endpoint still broken)
- ⚠️ **v1.2.12:** Enhanced structured logging (BUT MCP endpoint still broken)
- ⚠️ **v1.2.9-11:** Durable Objects migration (BUT never validated MCP endpoint actually works)

**The Problem:**
We've been deploying code with unit tests passing, but never validated the actual MCP protocol works end-to-end with real clients. The OAuth test script exists to catch this, but it's incomplete.

## Phase 16 - Durable Objects Session Management ✅ **COMPLETE**

**Goal:** Fix session persistence by migrating to Cloudflare Durable Objects

**Status:** ✅ Deployed to production as v1.2.9

### Completed Tasks

✅ **All tasks complete** - v1.2.9 deployed successfully
- Created MCPSessionDurableObject class with full session lifecycle management
- Configured wrangler.toml with Durable Objects bindings and migrations
- Updated mcp-api-handler.ts to route all requests to Durable Objects
- Cleaned up mcp-transport.ts (removed in-memory session storage)
- Added comprehensive test suite for Durable Object class
- Created cloudflare:workers mock for testing
- All tests passing (263/263) with 85.33% coverage
- Type checking passing
- Development environment deployed and tested
- Production deployment via GitHub Actions successful

### Implementation Details

**Files Created:**
- `src/mcp-session-do.ts` - Durable Object class with session management
- `test/unit/mcp-session-do.test.ts` - Comprehensive test suite
- `test/mocks/cloudflare-workers.ts` - Mock for testing

**Files Modified:**
- `wrangler.toml` - Added Durable Objects binding and migrations
- `src/index.ts` - Exported Durable Object, updated Env type
- `src/mcp-api-handler.ts` - Routes to Durable Object stubs
- `src/mcp-transport.ts` - Removed global session storage
- `jest.config.js` - Added module mapper for cloudflare:workers

### Results

✅ Sessions persist across Worker instances
✅ 30-minute session timeout with automatic cleanup
✅ Free tier compatible (100k requests/day)
✅ Test coverage increased from 79% to 85.33%
✅ All CI/CD checks passing
✅ Production deployment successful

## Future Phases (Parking Lot)

### Phase 17: Storage Quota Warnings (Nice to Have)
Add proactive warnings when approaching storage limits:
- Warning at 80% of quota
- Alert at 90% of quota
- Graceful degradation near limits

### Phase 18: Response Adapter Extraction (Low Priority)
Extract response adapter to separate module for better testability.

### Phase 19: Additional Monitoring (Future)
- Tool execution duration tracking
- Error rate monitoring
- Usage patterns analysis

## Development Workflow

1. Check PLAN.md for next task
2. Write tests first (TDD)
3. Implement feature
4. Run `pnpm test` (must pass)
5. Run `pnpm run type-check` (must pass)
6. Update PLAN.md status
7. Commit (include PLAN.md update)
8. Push to GitHub (triggers CI/CD)

**Deploy:** Always via GitHub Actions (never `pnpm deploy`)
