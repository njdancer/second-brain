# Implementation Plan

**Project:** MCP Server for Building a Second Brain (BASB)
**Status:** ✅ Production Ready - Phase 14 Complete
**Version:** v1.2.4
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-11

---

## Current Status

**Deployed:** ⚠️ Not deployed (deployment workflow issue discovered)
**CI/CD:** ✅ Operational (GitHub Actions, 37s test cycle)
**Test Coverage:** ✅ 258 tests, 79% coverage
**Architecture:** Direct Fetch API handlers, no frameworks
**Release Process:** ✅ Automated release script ready

**Recent Completions:**
- **Phase 14:** Removed Hono, added structured logging, MonitoringService integration
- **Release Process:** Created automated release script (`pnpm run release`)
  - Updates package.json, PLAN.md, CHANGELOG.md in one operation
  - Runs tests and type checking before release
  - Creates git tag automatically
  - Fixed deployment workflow documentation (tag-based, not push-based)

---

## Next Up: Phase 15 - Release & Deployment

**Goal:** Deploy v1.2.4 to production and verify functionality

### Tasks

**Release v1.2.4:**
- [ ] Run release script: `pnpm run release` (requires user interaction for CHANGELOG)
- [ ] Push release: `git push origin main --tags`
- [ ] Monitor GitHub Actions deployment
- [ ] Verify deployment successful

**Post-Deployment Verification:**
- [ ] Run E2E smoke tests against production: `pnpm run test:e2e:smoke`
- [ ] Check Cloudflare Logs for structured JSON output
- [ ] Verify OAuth flow works end-to-end
- [ ] Test all tools (read, write, edit, glob, grep)

**Polish (Optional):**
- [ ] Add storage quota warnings (MonitoringService)
- [ ] Review and update any stale documentation
- [ ] Clean up any remaining TODOs in code

**Commands:**
```bash
# Create release
pnpm run release        # Creates v1.2.4, commits, tags

# Deploy
git push origin main --tags  # Triggers GitHub Actions deployment

# Verify
pnpm run test:e2e:smoke     # Smoke tests against production
pnpm wrangler tail --format pretty  # Check logs
```

## Future Phases (Parking Lot)

### Phase 16: Storage Quota Warnings (Nice to Have)
Add proactive warnings when approaching storage limits:
- Warning at 80% of quota
- Alert at 90% of quota
- Graceful degradation near limits

### Phase 17: Response Adapter Extraction (Low Priority)
Extract Hono response adapter to separate module for better testability.

### Phase 18: Additional Monitoring (Future)
- Tool execution duration tracking
- Error rate monitoring
- Usage patterns analysis

## Development Workflow

1. Check PLAN.md for next task
2. Write tests first (TDD)
3. Implement feature
4. Run `pnpm test` (must pass)
5. Run `pnpm run type-check` (must pass)
6. Update PLAN.md status
7. Commit (include PLAN.md update)
8. Push to GitHub (triggers CI/CD)

**Deploy:** Always via GitHub Actions (never `pnpm deploy`)
