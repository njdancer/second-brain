# Implementation Plan

**Project:** MCP Server for Building a Second Brain (BASB)
**Status:** ðŸš§ In Progress - Phase 16 (Durable Objects)
**Version:** v1.2.9
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-11

---

## Current Status

**Deployed:** âœ… v1.2.8 in production (MCP method handling fixed)
**CI/CD:** âœ… Operational (GitHub Actions, ~35s cycle time)
**Test Coverage:** âœ… 258 tests passing, 79% coverage
**Architecture:** Direct Fetch API handlers, no frameworks
**Release Process:** âœ… Automated release script working perfectly

**Recent Completions:**
- âœ… **v1.2.8:** Fixed critical MCP method handling bug
  - Removed incorrect POST-only restriction from v1.2.7
  - Only parse JSON body for POST requests
  - GET (SSE streaming) and DELETE (termination) now work correctly
  - Deployed successfully via GitHub Actions
- âœ… **v1.2.6:** Added /health endpoint for deployment verification
- ðŸ”´ **v1.2.7:** Was broken (rejected GET requests) - now fixed in v1.2.8

**Known Issue:**
- ðŸ”´ **Session persistence broken**: In-memory session storage doesn't work across stateless Worker instances
- GET requests with session IDs fail because sessions stored in one Worker aren't accessible in others
- Requires Durable Objects for proper stateful session management

---

## Phase 16 - Durable Objects Session Management (NEXT)

**Goal:** Fix session persistence by migrating to Cloudflare Durable Objects

**Why:** Cloudflare Workers are stateless. Each request can go to a different Worker instance, so in-memory `Map<sessionId, transport>` doesn't persist. The MCP `StreamableHTTPServerTransport` requires stateful sessions for SSE streaming and request continuity.

**Good News:** Durable Objects are included in Cloudflare's free tier!
- 100,000 requests/day (more than enough for personal use)
- 13,000 GB-sec duration/day
- 5GB storage
- No upgrade needed âœ…

### Progress

- âœ… **Task 1-5:** Core implementation complete
  - wrangler.toml configured with Durable Objects binding and migrations
  - MCPSessionDurableObject class created with session management
  - MCP API handler refactored to route to Durable Objects
  - mcp-transport.ts cleaned up (removed in-memory session storage)
  - Env type updated with MCP_SESSIONS binding
  - All tests passing (253/253) âœ…
  - Type checking passing âœ…

- ðŸ”¨ **Task 6-8:** Testing and deployment (IN PROGRESS)
  - Local development ready (wrangler dev supports Durable Objects)
  - Need to test end-to-end session persistence
  - Need to deploy to development and verify
  - Need to deploy to production

**Files to create:**
- `src/mcp-session-do.ts` - New Durable Object class

**Files to modify:**
- `wrangler.toml` - Add Durable Objects binding
- `src/index.ts` - Export Durable Object, update Env type
- `src/mcp-api-handler.ts` - Route to Durable Objects
- `src/mcp-transport.ts` - Remove global session storage

**Testing strategy:**
- Unit tests for Durable Object (mock Durable Object environment)
- Integration tests for session persistence
- E2E tests with actual Durable Objects in dev

## Future Phases (Parking Lot)

### Phase 17: Storage Quota Warnings (Nice to Have)
Add proactive warnings when approaching storage limits:
- Warning at 80% of quota
- Alert at 90% of quota
- Graceful degradation near limits

### Phase 18: Response Adapter Extraction (Low Priority)
Extract response adapter to separate module for better testability.

### Phase 19: Additional Monitoring (Future)
- Tool execution duration tracking
- Error rate monitoring
- Usage patterns analysis

## Development Workflow

1. Check PLAN.md for next task
2. Write tests first (TDD)
3. Implement feature
4. Run `pnpm test` (must pass)
5. Run `pnpm run type-check` (must pass)
6. Update PLAN.md status
7. Commit (include PLAN.md update)
8. Push to GitHub (triggers CI/CD)

**Deploy:** Always via GitHub Actions (never `pnpm deploy`)
