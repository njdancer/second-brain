# Feature Flags Specification

**[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: This specification is a placeholder. Review and update this document before implementing feature flag functionality. After updating this spec, review all specifications that reference it (deployment.md, release.md) to ensure references remain accurate and complete.]**

Requirements for feature flag system that enables controlled rollout of incomplete or experimental features while maintaining production stability.

---

## Overview

**[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]** The feature flag system allows code containing incomplete or experimental features to be merged to `main` and deployed to production while keeping those features disabled until ready for release. This enables continuous integration without blocking feature branches on full completion.

The system must support request-scoped flag evaluation using Cloudflare KV storage, with flags organized into flag sets that can be assigned based on request characteristics (environment, IP address, cookies, headers, etc.).

## Flag Architecture

**[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Define the complete flag lifecycle]**

### Flag Sets

**[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]** Flag sets are collections of flag overrides that apply to specific request contexts. Each request is assigned to one flag set based on evaluation rules. Flag sets define which flags deviate from their default values.

**Common flag sets:**
- `production` - Default production configuration (typically all flags disabled)
- `development` - Development environment configuration (may enable experimental features)
- `testing` - Testing or staging environments
- Custom sets based on IP, user agent, cookies, headers, etc.

**[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How are flag sets stored in KV? What is the KV key structure? How are flag sets versioned or updated?]**

### Flag Set Assignment

**[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]** Each request must be assigned to a flag set through a series of evaluation functions. The assignment process should be functional (composable functions) rather than declarative (configuration-based).

**Evaluation approach:**
- Functions receive request object and return flag set name or pass to next function
- Functions execute in priority order (most specific to least specific)
- First function to return a flag set name wins
- If no function matches, use default flag set (typically "production")

**Example evaluation criteria:**
- Environment (development vs production)
- IP address allowlist/blocklist
- Request headers (e.g., `X-Feature-Flags: experimental`)
- Cookies (e.g., `feature_flags=beta`)
- User identity (if available in request context)

**[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How should evaluation functions be registered? Should they be defined in code or configurable? What is the performance impact of executing multiple evaluation functions per request? Should results be cached?]**

### Flag Storage

**[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]** Flags and flag sets must be stored in Cloudflare KV for runtime configuration without requiring redeployment.

**Storage requirements:**
- Flags must be accessible within request context (KV available in env)
- Flag reads must complete within milliseconds to avoid request latency
- Flag updates must propagate to edge locations within acceptable timeframe
- Invalid flag configurations must not crash request handlers

**[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What is the KV namespace name? What is the key structure? Should flag values be cached in memory per request? How are flag defaults defined if KV is unavailable?]**

## Flag Definition

**[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How are flags defined and documented?]**

### Flag Metadata

**[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]** Each flag should include:
- **Name** - Unique identifier for the flag
- **Description** - What feature or behavior the flag controls
- **Default value** - Value when flag is not overridden by flag set
- **Type** - Boolean, string, number, etc.
- **Added date** - When flag was created
- **Target removal date** - When flag should be removed (e.g., 3 months after creation)
- **Owner** - Who is responsible for the flagged feature

**[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Where is this metadata stored? In code? In KV? In a separate registry file?]**

### Flag Naming Conventions

**[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]** Flag names should follow a consistent convention:
- Use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE
- Prefix with feature area (e.g., `SEARCH_ADVANCED_RANKING`, `STORAGE_BATCH_OPERATIONS`)
- Avoid negative names (use `FEATURE_ENABLED` not `FEATURE_DISABLED`)

**[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should naming be enforced programmatically? Should there be a maximum flag name length?]**

## Flag Usage

**[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How should code access and check flag values?]**

### Accessing Flags

**[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]** Code must access flags from request context since KV bindings are only available in env:

```typescript
// Pseudocode example - NEEDS CLARIFICATION
async function handleRequest(request: Request, env: Env): Promise<Response> {
  const flagSet = await determineFlagSet(request, env);
  const flags = await loadFlags(flagSet, env);

  if (flags.ADVANCED_SEARCH) {
    // Feature-flagged code path
  } else {
    // Default code path
  }
}
```

**[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should there be a helper library or utility module for flag access? How should flag access be typed? Should missing flags throw errors or return defaults?]**

### Flag Performance

**[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]** Flag evaluation must not significantly impact request latency:
- Flag set determination should complete in <10ms
- Flag value lookups should complete in <5ms per flag
- Consider caching flags for the duration of a single request
- Consider pre-loading common flag sets into memory

**[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What is the acceptable performance overhead for flag checks? Should flags be cached across requests? How should cache invalidation work?]**

## Flag Management

**[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How are flags created, updated, and removed?]**

### Creating Flags

**[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]** Process for adding a new flag:
1. Define flag metadata (name, description, default, removal date)
2. Register flag in flag registry (location TBD)
3. Store flag set overrides in KV (if different from default)
4. Deploy code that checks the flag
5. Verify flag works in development environment

**[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should flag creation be automated? Should there be a CLI tool? Should flags require approval before being added?]**

### Updating Flags

**[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]** Process for changing flag values:
1. Update flag set definitions in KV
2. Changes propagate to edge locations (may take seconds to minutes)
3. No code deployment required
4. Verify changes via testing or monitoring

**[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How are flag updates tracked? Should there be an audit log? How do we prevent accidental flag changes?]**

### Removing Flags

**[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]** Process for removing a flag after feature is complete:
1. Enable flag in all flag sets (or remove overrides to use true default)
2. Monitor production for 1 week minimum
3. Remove flag checks from code (assume feature always enabled)
4. Remove flag from registry
5. Remove flag from KV storage
6. Document removal in commit message

**[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should flag removal be enforced by automated checks? Should flags auto-expire after target removal date?]**

## Flag Registry

**[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]** All active flags must be documented in a central registry to prevent flags from being forgotten and becoming permanent technical debt.

**Registry requirements:**
- Must list all active flags with metadata
- Must be easily searchable by developers
- Must include target removal dates
- Must identify flags older than 3 months for review

**[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Where should the registry live? In code (TypeScript constants)? In a markdown file? In KV? Should it be generated from flag definitions or manually maintained?]**

### Flag Cleanup Policy

**[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]** To prevent flag proliferation:
- Flags should be reviewed monthly
- Flags older than 3 months SHOULD be removed or justified
- Flags older than 6 months MUST be removed (enable permanently or delete feature)
- PRs adding flags SHOULD include target removal date

**[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should cleanup be automated? Should there be alerts when flags approach removal date?]**

## Integration with Deployment

**[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]** Feature flags interact with deployment and release processes:

### Development vs Production

**[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]** Development environment may enable experimental flags by default while production keeps them disabled. This allows testing incomplete features in development before production release.

**[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should development and production use different default flag sets? How is this configured in wrangler.toml or elsewhere?]**

### Gradual Rollout

**[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]** Feature flags could support gradual rollout strategies:
- Enable for specific test users first
- Enable for percentage of traffic
- Enable for specific geographic regions

**[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Is gradual rollout in scope for initial implementation? The single-user authorization model may make this unnecessary.]**

### Rollback Without Deployment

**[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]** Feature flags enable instant rollback of problematic features by toggling flags in KV without requiring code deployment. This provides faster mitigation than rolling back an entire deployment.

**[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How do we track which flags were changed during incident response? Should flag changes trigger notifications?]**

## Testing Considerations

**[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]** Tests must account for feature flags:
- Tests should verify both enabled and disabled code paths
- Tests should not depend on KV state
- Test fixtures should define flag states explicitly
- Integration tests should test flag set assignment logic

**[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should there be specific test utilities for mocking flag state? How should E2E tests handle flags?]**

## Security Considerations

**[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]** Feature flags must not create security vulnerabilities:
- Flag checks must not be bypassable through request manipulation
- Flag configuration changes must be auditable
- Flags must not expose sensitive information in responses
- Flag evaluation errors must fail safely (default to disabled)

**[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should flag set assignment be logged for security audit? Should certain flags require additional authentication to modify?]**
