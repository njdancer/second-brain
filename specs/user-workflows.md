# User Workflows

Common usage patterns and example interactions with the Second Brain MCP server.

---

## Connection Flow

### Initial Setup

1. User opens Claude (web, desktop, or mobile)
2. User navigates to Settings â†’ Integrations â†’ MCP Servers
3. User clicks "Add MCP Server"
4. User configures:
   - **Name:** Second Brain
   - **URL:** `https://second-brain.your-domain.workers.dev/sse`
   - **OAuth Client ID:** (from GitHub OAuth App)
   - **OAuth Client Secret:** (from GitHub OAuth App)
5. User clicks "Connect"
6. Browser opens to GitHub OAuth consent page
7. User signs in with GitHub (if not already)
8. Worker validates user against allowed list (`GITHUB_ALLOWED_USER_ID`)
9. User approves MCP access (scopes: `read:user`)
10. Browser redirects back to Claude with authorization
11. Worker issues tokens to Claude and stores in `OAUTH_KV`
12. MCP server becomes available in Claude's tools
13. On first tool use, bootstrap files are created if `/README.md` doesn't exist

### Reconnection

If token expires or user reconnects:
1. Claude attempts to refresh token automatically
2. If refresh fails, user must re-authenticate (steps 6-11 above)
3. Existing data persists (no data loss)

## Capture Workflow (Mobile)

### Quick Capture During Conversation

**User:** "I just had an idea for improving our onboarding flow. Can you save this to my second brain? The idea is to add a progress indicator showing users how far they are through setup."

**Claude:**
1. Recognizes capture intent
2. Analyzes content to determine PARA category (likely Projects or Areas)
3. Suggests filename: `onboarding-progress-indicator.md`
4. Calls `write` tool with formatted content:

```markdown
# Onboarding Progress Indicator

**Date:** 2025-10-07
**Context:** Conversation about UX improvements
**Tags:** #onboarding #ux #product

## Idea

Add a progress indicator showing users how far they are through setup.

## Benefits

- Reduces user uncertainty
- Improves completion rate
- Sets clear expectations

## Next Steps

- [ ] Design mockup
- [ ] User research validation
- [ ] Implementation planning
```

5. Confirms: "I've saved your onboarding improvement idea to `projects/product-improvements/onboarding-progress-indicator.md`. Would you like me to add any additional context or link it to related notes?"

### Using Capture Prompt

**User:** Invokes MCP prompt: `capture-note`

**Prompt Arguments:**

# Knowledge Management Trends 2025

**Source:** TechCrunch article
**Date Saved:** 2025-10-07
**Tags:** #knowledge-management #trends #pkm

## Key Trends

### 1. AI-Powered Knowledge Assistants
**Personal AI assistants** are transforming how we capture and retrieve information.
They can **automatically categorize, summarize, and surface relevant content** based
on context and user behavior.

### 2. Networked Thinking
**Bidirectional linking** and **graph views** help users see **connections between ideas**.
Tools are moving beyond hierarchical folders to **network-based organization**.

### 3. Action-Oriented Organization
**Organizing by actionability** (like PARA) is gaining popularity over topic-based filing.
**Users want to find what they need for current projects**, not maintain perfect taxonomies.

## Summary

Knowledge management is shifting toward **AI assistance**, **networked thinking**, and
**action-oriented organization**. The future is about **tools that help you work**, not
just store information.

## Personal Insights

- This aligns with my BASB approach âœ“
- Should explore AI features for my second brain
- Graph view would be valuable for Phase 2
```
