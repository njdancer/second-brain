## Usage Metrics (Post-Launch)

### Quantitative Metrics

| Metric | Target (Month 1) | Target (Month 3) |
|--------|------------------|------------------|
| Notes created per week | 10-20 | 30-50 |
| Tool usage frequency | 50 calls/week | 200 calls/week |
| Search queries per week | 5-10 | 20-30 |
| Files per PARA category | Balanced | Balanced |
| Average note size | 1-2KB | 2-5KB |
| Links between notes | 5-10 | 50-100 |
| Weekly review completion | 75% | 90% |

### Qualitative Metrics

- **Knowledge retrieval success:** Can I find what I need when I need it?
- **Organizational clarity:** Does PARA structure make sense for my work?
- **Capture friction:** How easy is it to capture thoughts on mobile?
- **Review effectiveness:** Do weekly reviews surface valuable insights?
- **Long-term value:** Am I building a valuable knowledge base?

## Known Limitations

### Current (MVP)

1. **No offline access:** Requires internet connection for both Claude and R2
2. **File format:** Only text/markdown files (no images, PDFs, etc.)
3. **Search limitations:** Regex only, no semantic search
4. **No version history:** Edits overwrite previous versions
5. **Rate limits:** Prevents very large operations (intentional)
6. **Storage caps:** 10GB per user, 10,000 files max (cost control)
7. **Single bucket:** All data in one R2 bucket (simplicity choice)
8. **GitHub dependency:** OAuth tied to GitHub (could add other providers later)
9. **Backup delay:** Daily backups mean up to 24h data loss window
10. **PoC status:** No formal documentation or support structure yet

### Technical Debt

- No retry logic for R2 operations
- Basic rate limiting (no burst allowance)
- No request deduplication
- Limited error context in responses
- No structured audit logs
- Manual secret rotation

## Open Questions

### MVP Questions

1. **Prompt defaults:** Should prompts be included in MVP or added later based on usage patterns?
   - **Decision:** Include basic prompts in MVP, iterate based on usage

2. **Error verbosity:** Should error messages expose internal details or stay generic?
   - **Decision:** Generic errors to users, detailed logs internally

3. **Backup timing:** Is 2 AM UTC appropriate or should it be configurable?
   - **Decision:** Fixed time for MVP, make configurable in Phase 2

4. **File size limits:** Are 1MB write / 10MB read limits appropriate for typical use?
   - **Decision:** Start with these limits, monitor usage and adjust

5. **Mobile optimization:** Do we need special mobile-specific tools or are existing tools sufficient?
   - **Decision:** Existing tools sufficient, optimize prompts for mobile

### Future Questions

1. **Pricing model:** Should multi-user version be paid?
2. **Collaboration:** How to enable shared second brains?
3. **AI features:** Which AI capabilities add most value?
4. **Integration priority:** Which integrations are most requested?
5. **File formats:** Should we support PDFs, images, etc.?
