## 1. Current State Inventory

### 1.1 Server Instructions

**Location:** `src/mcp-transport.ts:50-70`

**Purpose:** Primary system prompt visible to Claude explaining BASB methodology and organizational guidance.

**Current Content:**
```
Your personal knowledge management assistant using Building a Second Brain (BASB) methodology.

BASB FRAMEWORK:
- CODE Workflow: Capture ‚Üí Organize ‚Üí Distill ‚Üí Express
- PARA Structure: Projects (active goals) ‚Üí Areas (ongoing responsibilities) ‚Üí Resources (reference topics) ‚Üí Archives (inactive items)

ORGANIZATION PRINCIPLES:
- Organize by actionability, not topic
- Projects have deadlines and defined outcomes
- Areas require sustained attention with no end date
- Resources are topics of interest for future use
- Archives preserve completed/inactive items

FILE STRUCTURE:
All notes are markdown files organized by path:
- projects/{project-name}/ - Active projects with specific goals
- areas/{area-name}/ - Ongoing responsibilities
- resources/{topic}/ - Reference material and interests
- archives/{year}/ - Completed/inactive items

Let the structure emerge naturally through use. Create folders as needed by creating files within them.
```

**Analysis:**
- ‚úÖ Concise and well-structured
- ‚úÖ Covers essential BASB concepts
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Missing:** Explicit guidance for Claude's behavior (see specs/bootstrap.md:48-58)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Missing:** Instructions for progressive summarization, filename conventions, connection building

### 1.2 Tool Descriptions

**Location:** `src/mcp-transport.ts:75-198`

**Purpose:** Describe the 5 MCP tools available to Claude and define their parameters.

| Tool | Description | Assessment |
|------|-------------|------------|
| **read** | "Read file contents with optional range selection" | ‚úÖ Clear and accurate |
| **write** | "Create new file or overwrite existing file" | ‚úÖ Clear and accurate |
| **edit** | "Edit existing file using string replacement, with optional move/rename/delete" | ‚úÖ Clear, covers multiple operations |
| **glob** | "Find files matching a pattern" | ‚úÖ Clear and accurate |
| **grep** | "Search file contents using regex" | ‚úÖ Clear and accurate |

**Parameter Descriptions:**

All 5 tools have detailed parameter descriptions that are clear and helpful:
- ‚úÖ `read` path: "Path to file (e.g., "projects/app/notes.md")" - includes example
- ‚úÖ `glob` pattern: "Glob pattern (e.g., "projects/**/*.md", "*.md")" - includes examples
- ‚úÖ Tool descriptions use proper grammar and punctuation

**Overall Quality:** ‚úÖ **EXCELLENT** - Tool descriptions are clear, concise, and include helpful examples.

### 1.3 MCP Prompts

**Location:** `src/mcp-transport.ts:268-405`

**Specification:** `specs/prompts.md`

**Purpose:** Pre-defined workflow templates that users explicitly invoke through Claude's MCP prompt interface.

#### Prompt 1: capture-note

**Description:** "Quick capture workflow for capturing notes"

**Arguments:**
- `content` (required) - "The note content to capture"
- `context` (optional) - "Where this came from (conversation, article URL, etc.)"

### 1.5 Resource Descriptions

**Location:** `src/mcp-transport.ts:414-426, 486-500`

**Purpose:** Expose all second brain documents as MCP resources with metadata.

**Current Implementation:**

1. **Individual Resource Description:**
   ```
   description: `Document in ${obj.key.split('/').slice(0, -1).join('/')}`
   ```
   Example: `"Document in projects/launch-app"`

2. **Resource Template Description:**
   ```
   description: 'Access any document in your second brain by path (e.g., projects/app/notes.md)'
   ```

**Analysis:**
- ‚úÖ Resources are exposed and functional (Phase 19.1 complete)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Clarity Issue:** Individual resource descriptions are not very informative
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Missed Opportunity:** Could include file size, last modified date in human-readable format
- üí° **Enhancement:** Could use title/name differently (currently both are full path)

---

## 2. Detailed Analysis

### 2.1 Consistency Check

**Between Implementation and Specs:**

| Component | Spec Location | Implementation Status | Consistency |
|-----------|---------------|----------------------|-------------|
| Server Instructions | `specs/bootstrap.md:25-58` | `src/mcp-transport.ts:50-70` | ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIAL** - Missing "GUIDANCE FOR CLAUDE" section |
| Tool Descriptions | `specs/tools.md` | `src/mcp-transport.ts:75-198` | ‚úÖ **MATCH** |
| Prompt Templates | `specs/prompts.md` | `src/mcp-transport.ts:328-374` | ‚úÖ **MATCH** |
| Bootstrap READMEs | `specs/bootstrap.md:25-58` | `src/bootstrap.ts:60-146` | ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIAL** - Main README missing CODE workflow |
| Resource Descriptions | N/A (implementation-defined) | `src/mcp-transport.ts:414-426` | N/A |

**Key Inconsistency Found:**

The specs/bootstrap.md (lines 48-58) specify that server instructions MUST include explicit guidance for Claude:

```
GUIDANCE FOR CLAUDE:
When working with the second brain:
1. Suggest descriptive, kebab-case filenames (e.g., product-launch-plan.md)
2. Help users decide PARA placement based on actionability
3. Create connections between related notes using markdown links
4. During capture, add metadata (date, source, tags) at the top of notes
5. Encourage progressive summarization (bold key points)
6. Suggest moving completed projects to archives with year prefix
7. During weekly reviews, identify orphaned notes and suggest categorization
8. Recommend specific, outcome-oriented project names over vague ones
```

**This guidance is MISSING from the actual server instructions** (`src/mcp-transport.ts:50-70`).
